        <h3>Discuss your methodology and your results.</h3>
        <p>Since this website is going to be an art gallery of sorts I made each card a different picture. I provided enough for 3 (planned) groups: Ocean, Mountains, and Dilapidated Buildings.</p>
        <p>I chose to have three people look through the cards at my office and see how they would sort them. The first two people sorted the pictures very similarly. The only difference between the two being the names they provided for the groupings. For example one person said ocean and the other said beach. Both of which were present in the pictures. One chose dilapidated and other labeled the group Abandoned Water Park. They both chose mountains for the final one.
        </p>
        <p>Since both of these people answered very similarly I chose to have a third person go through the cards. I am glad I did. The first question from this user was “is there a limit to the amount of groups?” I told him that there was not and he could have as little or as many as he chose to create. He ended up coming up with six groups compared to the other two users three groups!  Waves, Scenic View, Old Buildings, Bird, Beach, and Abandoned Water Slide. I asked him how he arrived at his six groups. He said he decided to look at the what he perceived to be the focal point of each picture and not just the content of the picture. From there he was able to sort the pictures down further.

        <h3>Did your findings alter your initial approach?</h3>
        <p>Yes this did alter my approach. As mentioned above since the first two were so similar I decided to get my third user to look at it. This will also change how we proceed with groupings moving forward on the page. I may have one more person who is a bit more art minded like the last one sort the cards if they are available. I am also considering having the third user run through some more cards for me as well if he has the time later this week.
        </p>
        <p>I was unable to schedule another time to meet up with the last user or an additional user this week.</p>
