        <h3>Who did you test your idea with?</h3>
        <p>I tested the protoype with two of the people I did the card sorting assignment with.</p>
        <h3>What were you testing for? (This will be the tasks that you identified in your Evaluation Plan)</h3>
        <p>This prototype was used to test navigating to the gallery and sorting the pictures based on given criteria.</p>

        <h3>What did people value the most?</h3>
        <p>Both users liked the home page having minimal content unlike my original idea of just having the gallery front and center.
        They were able to quickly navigate to the gallery, then use the options to sort them.</p>
        <h3>What got them excited?</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, I believe what would have gotten them excited was the addition of a homepage that shows "top" or recent photos.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>What failed?</h3>
        <p>From what feedback I gathered nothing outright failed with the design. They did offer suggestions on additional functionality (see next point).</p>
        <h3>Were there suggestions for improvement?</h3>
        <p>Both users suggested having more options for sorting the pictures. They mentioned like how they added things like mountians, ocean, etc. in the card sorting project.</p>
        <h3>What needs further investigation?</h3>
        <p>To implement this suggestion, I am picturing a simple database with a table linking the image file names to a list of tags. The tags are then parsed by a javascript function when clicking on the option for viewing. This should be fairly straightforward like most blog websites.</p>
